 *** SERIOUS PROBLEMS ***
 ========================
 The following problems may have a significant effect on data quality
 Action should be taken to eliminate these warnings.

 ERROR IN DETECTOR GAIN
 ======================
 The ratio of the observed variation in background pixels to that
 expected statistically (the BGRATIO) lies outside the range 0.9 to 1.1.
 Actual values: minimum:  1.56  maximum:  1.56
 The most likely explanation is that the GAIN of the detector is incorrect.
 The current GAIN is 0.30 but the observed BGRATIO suggests it should be
 set to 0.73.
 NOTE however that diffuse scatter can lead to an increased value of BGRATIO
 even when the gain is correct.
 Since the gain for any detector should remain constant, it should be worked out
 for a crystal giving strong diffraction and "clean" spots (ie no disorder or
 diffuse scatter)and kept at this value.
 Processing data with an incorrect gain will result in a systematic 
 overestimate of very weak reflections and incorrect standard deviations.


 *** PROBLEMS WORTH CONSIDERING ***
 ==================================
 The following warnings suggest that the processing might be improved
 if appropriate action is taken.

 EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF BADSPOTS
 ============================
 At least some images have rather a lot of badspots (Maximum number  23)
 They are rejected on the basis of: 
 1) Poor profile fit (PKRATIO >3, controlled by REJECTION PKRATIO).
 2) Too large a BGRATIO (too much background variation, controlled by
    REJECTION BGRATIO).
 3) Too large a background gradient (controlled by REJECTION GRADMAX)
 4) Intensity negative and more than 5 sigma.
 Look at the list of badspots to see what category they fall under.

 Not defining the backstop shadow can give large background plane gradients.
 Very intense images can have unusually large gradients, GRADMAX may have to
 be changed from the default
 A pixel dump of the BADSPOTS can be obtained using REJECTION PLOT
 if the reason for their rejection is not clear
