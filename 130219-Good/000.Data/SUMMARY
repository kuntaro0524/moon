 *** Warning messages ***

 There are no SERIOUS problems.


 *** PROBLEMS WORTH CONSIDERING ***
 ==================================
 The following warnings suggest that the processing might be improved
 if appropriate action is taken.

 EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF BADSPOTS
 ============================
 At least some images have rather a lot of badspots (Maximum number  36)
 They are rejected on the basis of: 
 1) Poor profile fit (PKRATIO >3, controlled by REJECTION PKRATIO).
 2) Too large a BGRATIO (too much background variation, controlled by
    REJECTION BGRATIO).
 3) Too large a background gradient (controlled by REJECTION GRADMAX)
 4) Intensity negative and more than 5 sigma.
 Look at the list of badspots to see what category they fall under.

 Not defining the backstop shadow can give large background plane gradients.
 Very intense images can have unusually large gradients, GRADMAX may have to
 be changed from the default
 A pixel dump of the BADSPOTS can be obtained using REJECTION PLOT
 if the reason for their rejection is not clear

 LARGE ERROR IN YSCALE PARAMETER
 ===============================
 YSCALE differs from the default value by a maximum of  0.0151
 YSCALE allows for the pixels in the detector not being square.
 However, all detectors except the R-axis do have square pixels and so
 YSCALE should be 1.000.
 Significantly different values of YSCALE usually indicate errors in cell
 parameters which are being compensated by changing YSCALE. If YSCALE changes
 as a function of rotation angle this is almost certainly the reason.
 If the cell has not yet been refined, then try this first.
 Use 2 or more segments of data widely separated in phi.
 The cell can also change as a result of radiation damage,in which case further
 refinement will probably not help.


 POOR PROFILES IN SOME AREAS
 ===========================
 For  7 profiles the correlation coefficient with the central profile is less than 0.5.
 Smallest correlation coefficient is -0.77
 Possible reasons are:
 1) Very weak diffraction (consider cutting back the resolution)
 2) Errors in cell parameters (check DELX, DELY for the standard profiles).
 3) Genuine variation due to high obliquity (for example).
 4) Presence of zingers or spots from an ice or salt crystal which are much
 stronger than the protein spots. Sometimes these can be rejected using
 the PROFILE CUTOFF keywords.

 A low correlation does NOT necessarily mean that the processing needs to be changed.

 The image number, profile box number and correlation coefficient for
 up to the first 6 occurences are:
   ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN   
    1   1   0.13      1   3  -0.77      1   4  -0.77      1   6  -0.21
    1   7  -0.62      1   8  -0.19


 *** THE FOLLOWING ARE MAINLY FOR INFORMATION ***
 ================================================
 In some cases it may be possible to change the processing to eliminate
 some of these warnings.

 SPOT OVERLAP
 ============
 Adjacent spots overlap. This will produce systematic errors in the intensities.
 Note that this warning will arise even if only one pair of spots in
 one area of the detector overlap. Look at the standard profiles to see how
 serious the overlap is.
 The minimum allowed spot separation (SEPARATION keyword) was  0.5 0.4mm.
 The actual spot size determined by the mask optimisation is 0.5 by 0.4mm
 in the centre of the image and the largest spot size is 0.8 by 1.0mm.
 The separation given should be at least as large as the spot size
 in the centre of the image (keyword SEPARATION).
 Check standard profiles carefully to ensure that the optimisation of the
 raster parameters has worked correctly.
 The effective size of the spots can be controlled by PROFILE TOLERANCE 
 keywords. If the peak regions look too large (ie they include too much of the
 tails of the spot), try increasing TOLERANCE (current value 0.030) by
 eg 0.005 and see if profiles look better.
 (Increasing TOLERANCE will decrease spot size).
 As a last resort the profile optimisation can be turned off using keywords
 PROFILE NOOPT.

 In cases of serious overlap, (ie if the pattern is very dense), then the
 SEPARATION CLOSE option should be used (eg SEPARATION  1.0 1.0 CLOSE)
 and it may also help to suppress profile optimisation in these cases
 (PROFILE NOOPT)keyword. See help library for details.

 TOO MANY BACKGROUND PIXELS OVERLAPPED BY NEIGHBOURING SPOTS
 ===========================================================
 For some of the standard profiles, more than half the background pixels are
 flagged as being overlapped by neighbouring spots (in the worst case, 100.0%
  are overlapped).
 You should use the SEPARATION CLOSE keywords, eg SEPARATION 1.0 1.0 CLOSE
