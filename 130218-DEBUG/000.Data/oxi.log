 The oscillation axis is parallel to the fast axis in the image (scanner Y)

 Parameters affecting refinement (REFINE keyword)
 ================================================
 Initial refinement uses up to 200 (MAXREF) reflections within  56.0mm (LIMIT)
 of the image centre. A minimum of  20 reflections (NREF) are required.
 The spots must have an rms variation in pixel values more than 20 times 
 that expected for a uniform background (NSIG).
 PARTIALS and OVERLOADS will be rejected for positional refinement unless
 there are not enough fully recorded non-overloaded reflections.
 (Use INCLUDE PARTIALS or INCLUDE OVERLOADS to use these spots by default.)
 The measurement box will be used in the initial determination of the centre
 of gravity of spots in the central region (USEBOX)

 Following   2 cycles of refinement (CYCLES) if the weighted residual
 exceeds 10.0 (RESID) then processing will be abandoned.
 For the outer regions of the image, spots with I/(sigma(I)) > CUTOFF will be
 selected where CUTOFF is  40 for the outermost bins and is incremented by
  10 for each bin working towards centre of image (IMIN)
 For spots selected for refinement, the maximum  allowed value for
 (background gradient)/(average background is 0.030 (GRADIENT) and the
 maximum allowed fraction of rejected background pixels is 0.50 (BGREJECT)
 Reflections will be weighted by the estimated error in the position
 of their centre of gravity (WEIGHT)

 The refined detector parameters will be smoothed (use NOSMOOTH to stop
 smoothing). The smoothing will be done over   5 degrees (NSM1) for CCOMEGA,
 YSCALE and DISTANCE and over   10 (NSM2) degrees for all other parameters.


 PROFILE FITTING
 ===============
 (Use PROFILE OFF to suppress profile fitting)
 The default profile binning for this resolution giving 9 standard profiles
 will be used (Default is 21 bins above 2.5A, 9 below)
 To change this use XLINES/YLINES to define the areas you want
 The measurement box parameters will be optimised for every standard
 profile independently (OPTIMISE). The parameters used in the optimisation are:
 Toleance (TOLERANCE) Minimum 0.020 Maximum 0.030  Boundary (BOUNDARY)  6
 See the help library for a description of these parameters
 (To switch off optimisation for all standard profiles use NOOPT, to turn it off
 for the average central spot profile also use NOOPT ATALL)
 The overall dimensions will be set to achieve a minimum ratio of background
 to peak pixels of 2.00 (RATIO)
 The expansion in either direction to achieve this will be
 halted when more than 0.50 of the pixels are rejected (STOP)
 (Use FIXBOX to switch off optimisation of OVERALL dimensions of box)
 Reflections with peak pixel intensity less than  2 times (ISDR) the rms
 variation in background density will be rejected from the STANDARD PROFILES
 For the standard profiles, background points which lie more than
  99.0 sigma (BGSIG) from the best least squares plane will be rejected
 Spots with more than  0 (NOVPIX under OVERLOADS) pixel values greater
 than   59999 (CUTOFF) will be treated as OVERLOADS and excluded.
 The rejection criteria applied to each profile are:
 Minimum number of reflections contributing to profile  10 (NREF)
 Maximum rms variation in background (after scaling peak to 255) 20.0 (RMSBG)

 Pixel values will be interpolated to place CALCULATED spot position
 in centre of measurement box (INTERPOLATE).

 The background mask for each measurement box will be updated on the basis of
 background points rejected from the standard profile for that box.
 The updated mask will be used in the  integration pass (CHANGEMASK).

 Profiles will be accumulated over  1 images (BLOCK subkeyword on PROCESS line)
 prior to integration (ACCUMULATE).

 All profiles will be printed (PRINT).

 The least-squares fit of the standard profiles to individual spot pixel
 values will be weighted (WEIGHT).
 In the formation of the standard profiles, each reflection will
 be weighted using counting statistics (WSUM).

 A separate profile will be calculated for every reflection as a
 weighted sum of neighbouring profiles (VARIABLE).

 For fully recorded reflections, individual peak pixels will be rejected
 from profile fitting if their fit to the scaled profile deviates by more
 than   20.0 times the expected error (WDLIM1).
 For ALL reflections, for pixels adjacent to overlapped pixels, the
 rejection factor is   20.0 (WDLIM2).

 When forming the profiles, spots that lie within shells centred on ice
 rings will be excluded. The half-width of the shells is set to 0.0050
 times the actual resolution (ICE).

 When forming the profiles, a fraction 0.050 of the reflections that have
 the highest pixel values in each profile will be excluded, to eliminate
 the effect of zingers and hot pixels (PRCUT).


 REFLECTION INTEGRATION
 ======================
 OVERLOADS (OVERLOAD):
 Any reflection with more than  0 (NOVER) pixels with a
 value greater than   59999 (CUTOFF) will be flagged as overloads.

 Background evaluation (BACKGROUND):
 A fraction 0.80 (BGFRAC) of the background pixels
 will be used in the initial determination of the plane constants
 Pixels deviating by more than  3.0 (BGSIG) sigma from this initial
 plane will be rejected.

 If there are fewer than 50 background pixels remaining after rejecting
 those overlapped by neighbouring spots, background pixels with
 the lowest values in the standard profile will be included until 50 background
 pixels are obtained. This number is RECLEVEL*NBGMIN where RECLEVEL is set by
 keywords BACKGROUND RECOVER RECLEVEL and NBGMIN by REJECTION MINBG NBGMIN

 REJECTION CRITERIA (REJECTION):
 Reflections for which the (background gradient)/(average background) is
 greater than 0.030 will be rejected (GRADMAX)
 Minimum number of background pixels remaining after rejection of
 outliers  10 (MINB)
 Maximum BGRATIO   3.0 (BGRATIO)
 Maximum PKRATIO   5.0 (PKRATIO)
 Reflections failing the PKRATIO test will be rejected (use REJECT PKRATIO ACCEPT
  to keep the summation integration value.)

 Rejected reflections will be omitted from the MTZ file.

 Partial reflections spanning more than 50 images will NOT be integrated
 (use MAXWIDTH to change)

 Average spot profile will be printed for all packs

 **** WARNING **** Peaks of neighbouring reflections overlap, data quality will be impaired

 In the following profiles, background pixels are indictated by a "-" sign and rejected background pixels (due to
 overlap by a neighbouring spot) are indicated by a "*". Pixels with negative values are denoted by a "]".
 Note that a background pixel is rejected if it is overlapped by a neighbouring spot for ANY reflection in that
  area of the detector.
 If too many background pixels are being rejected try the SEPARATION CLOSE keywords (see help library)

 List of BADSPOTS
 INT and SD are the profile fitted intensity and sigma.
 A,B,C are the background plane constants. M/100 is the degree of partiality
 (M=0 for fully recorded). XS, YS are scanner coordinates in pixels wrt origin
 at the first pixel in the image.
 BADSPOTS will be written to the output MTZ file, but will be flagged and will be
 rejected by AIMLESS/SCALA by default.

 **** WARNING ****
 There are no fully recorded non-rejected reflections so the detector error
 factor cannot be calculated
 The input detector error factor of  0.07 will be used


  2950 Spots measured on this image
     0 are fully recorded,    0 are OVERLOADS    0 Outside active area
 Reflections "Outside active area" are those with pixel values less than or equal to    0
 This value can be changed with keyword NULLPIX.
   0 Reflections partially outside the scan have been profile fitted, but these will be
 rejected by SCALA by default.
 The intensities of overloaded reflections have been estimated by profile fitting.
 These will be rejected by AIMLESS/SCALA by default, but can be included by using ACCEPT keywords.

 *** Warning messages ***

 There are no SERIOUS problems.


 *** PROBLEMS WORTH CONSIDERING ***
 ==================================
 The following warnings suggest that the processing might be improved
 if appropriate action is taken.

 EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF BADSPOTS
 ============================
 At least some images have rather a lot of badspots (Maximum number  36)
 They are rejected on the basis of: 
 1) Poor profile fit (PKRATIO >3, controlled by REJECTION PKRATIO).
 2) Too large a BGRATIO (too much background variation, controlled by
    REJECTION BGRATIO).
 3) Too large a background gradient (controlled by REJECTION GRADMAX)
 4) Intensity negative and more than 5 sigma.
 Look at the list of badspots to see what category they fall under.

 Not defining the backstop shadow can give large background plane gradients.
 Very intense images can have unusually large gradients, GRADMAX may have to
 be changed from the default
 A pixel dump of the BADSPOTS can be obtained using REJECTION PLOT
 if the reason for their rejection is not clear

 LARGE ERROR IN YSCALE PARAMETER
 ===============================
 YSCALE differs from the default value by a maximum of  0.0151
 YSCALE allows for the pixels in the detector not being square.
 However, all detectors except the R-axis do have square pixels and so
 YSCALE should be 1.000.
 Significantly different values of YSCALE usually indicate errors in cell
 parameters which are being compensated by changing YSCALE. If YSCALE changes
 as a function of rotation angle this is almost certainly the reason.
 If the cell has not yet been refined, then try this first.
 Use 2 or more segments of data widely separated in phi.
 The cell can also change as a result of radiation damage,in which case further
 refinement will probably not help.


 POOR PROFILES IN SOME AREAS
 ===========================
 For  7 profiles the correlation coefficient with the central profile is less than 0.5.
 Smallest correlation coefficient is -0.77
 Possible reasons are:
 1) Very weak diffraction (consider cutting back the resolution)
 2) Errors in cell parameters (check DELX, DELY for the standard profiles).
 3) Genuine variation due to high obliquity (for example).
 4) Presence of zingers or spots from an ice or salt crystal which are much
 stronger than the protein spots. Sometimes these can be rejected using
 the PROFILE CUTOFF keywords.

 A low correlation does NOT necessarily mean that the processing needs to be changed.

 The image number, profile box number and correlation coefficient for
 up to the first 6 occurences are:
   ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN   
    1   1   0.13      1   3  -0.77      1   4  -0.77      1   6  -0.21
    1   7  -0.62      1   8  -0.19


 *** THE FOLLOWING ARE MAINLY FOR INFORMATION ***
 ================================================
 In some cases it may be possible to change the processing to eliminate
 some of these warnings.

 Adjacent spots overlap. This will produce systematic errors in the intensities.
 Note that this warning will arise even if only one pair of spots in
 one area of the detector overlap. Look at the standard profiles to see how
 serious the overlap is.
 The minimum allowed spot separation (SEPARATION keyword) was  0.5 0.4mm.
 The actual spot size determined by the mask optimisation is 0.5 by 0.4mm
 in the centre of the image and the largest spot size is 0.8 by 1.0mm.
 The separation given should be at least as large as the spot size
 in the centre of the image (keyword SEPARATION).
 Check standard profiles carefully to ensure that the optimisation of the
 raster parameters has worked correctly.
 The effective size of the spots can be controlled by PROFILE TOLERANCE 
 keywords. If the peak regions look too large (ie they include too much of the
 tails of the spot), try increasing TOLERANCE (current value 0.030) by
 eg 0.005 and see if profiles look better.
 (Increasing TOLERANCE will decrease spot size).
 As a last resort the profile optimisation can be turned off using keywords
 PROFILE NOOPT.

 In cases of serious overlap, (ie if the pattern is very dense), then the
 SEPARATION CLOSE option should be used (eg SEPARATION  1.0 1.0 CLOSE)
 and it may also help to suppress profile optimisation in these cases
 (PROFILE NOOPT)keyword. See help library for details.

 TOO MANY BACKGROUND PIXELS OVERLAPPED BY NEIGHBOURING SPOTS
 ===========================================================
 For some of the standard profiles, more than half the background pixels are
 flagged as being overlapped by neighbouring spots (in the worst case, 100.0%
  are overlapped).
 You should use the SEPARATION CLOSE keywords, eg SEPARATION 1.0 1.0 CLOSE
