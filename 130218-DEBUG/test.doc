Appendix 2: Scaling algorithm

          For each reflection h, we have a number of observations Ihl,
          with estimated standard deviation shl, which defines a weight
          whl. We need to determine the inverse scale factor ghl to put
          each observation on a common scale (as Ihl/ghl). This is done by
          minimizing

        Sum( whl * ( Ihl - ghl * Ih )**2 )   Ref Hamilton, Rollett & Sparks

          where Ih is the current best estimate of the "true" intensity
        Ih = Sum ( whl * ghl * Ihl ) / Sum ( whl * ghl**2)

          Each observation is assigned to a "run", which corresponds to a
          set of scale factors. A run would typically consist of a
          continuous rotation of a crystal about a single axis.
          The inverse scale factor ghl is derived as follows:
        ghl = Thl * Chl * Shl

          where Thl is an optional relative B-factor contribution, Chl is
          a scale factor (1-dimensional or 3-dimensional (ie DETECTOR
          option)), and Shl is a anisotropic correction expressed as
          spherical harmonics (ie SECONDARY, ABSORPTION or SURFACE
          options).
          a) B-factor (optional)
          For each run, a relative B-factor (Bi) is determined at
          intervals in "time" ("time" is normally defined as rotation
          angle if no independent time value is available), at positions
          ti (t1, t2, . . tn). Then for an observation measured at time tl
        B = Sum[i=1,n] ( p(delt) Bi ) / Sum (p(delt))
        where   Bi  are the B-factors at time ti
                delt    = tl - ti
                p(delt) = exp ( - (delt)**2 / Vt )
                Vt  is "variance" of weight, & controls the smoothness
                        of interpolation
        Thl = exp ( + 2 s B )
                s = (sin theta / lambda)**2

          An alternative anisotropic B-factor may be used to correct for
          anisotropic fall-off of scattering: THIS OPTION IS NOT
          RECOMMENDED. This is parameterized on the components of the
          scattering vector (divided by 2 for compatibility with the
          normal definition of B) in two directions perpendicular to the
          Xray beam (y & z in the "Cambridge" coordinate frame with x
          along the beam).
        Thl = exp ( + 2[uy**2 Byy + 2 uy uz Byz + uz**2 Bzz])
        where  uy, uz are the components of d*/2

          Byy, Byz, Bzz are functions of time ti or batch as for the
          isotropic Bfactor. The principal components of B (Bfac_min,
          Bfac_max) are also printed.
          b) Scale factors
          For each run, scale factors Cxyz are determined at positions
          (x,y) on the detector, at intervals on rotation angle z. Then
          for an observation at position (x0, y0, z0),
        Chl(x0, y0, z0) =
   Sum(z)[p(delz){Sum(xy)[q(delxy)*Cxyz]/Sum(xy)[q(delxy)]}/Sum(z)[p(delz)]
where   delz    = z - z0
        p(delz) = exp(-delz**2/Vz)
        q(delxy)= exp(-((x-x0)**2 + (y-y0)**2)/Vxy)
        Vz, Vxy are the "variances" of the weight & control the smoothness
                of interpolation

          For the SCALES BATCH option, the scale along z is discontinuous:
          the normal option has one scale factor (or set of scale factors
          across the detector) for each batch. The SLOPE (not recommended)
          option has two scale factors per batch, with the scale
          interpolated linearly between the beginning and end according to
          the rotation angle of the reflection.
          c) Anisotropy factor
          The optional surface or anisotropy factor Shl is expressed as a
          sum of spherical harmonic terms as a function of the direction
          of
          (1) the secondary beam (SECONDARY correction) in the camera
          spindle frame,
          (2) the secondary beam (ABSORPTION correction) in the crystal
          frame, permuted to put either a*, b* or c* along the spherical
          polar axis
          or
          (3) the scattering vector in the crystal frame (SURFACE option).

    1. SECONDARY beam direction (camera frame)
         s  =  [Phi] [UB] h
         s2 = s - s0
         s2' = [-Phi] s2
Polar coordinates:
         s2' = (x y z)
         PolarTheta = arctan(sqrt(x**2 + y**2)/z)
         PolarPhi   = arctan(y/x)
                             where [Phi] is the spindle rotation matrix
                                   [-Phi] is its inverse
                                   [UB]  is the setting matrix
                                   h = (h k l)

    2. ABSORPTION: Secondary beam direction (permuted crystal frame)
         s    = [Phi] [UB] h
         s2   = s - s0
         s2c' = [-Q] [-U] [-Phi] s2
Polar coordinates:
         s2' = (x y z)
         PolarTheta = arctan(sqrt(x**2 + y**2)/z)
         PolarPhi   = arctan(y/x)
                             where [Phi] is the spindle rotation matrix
                                   [-Phi] is its inverse
                                   [Q] is a permutation matrix to put
                                       h, k, or l along z (see POLE option)
                                   [U]  is the orientation matrix
                                   [B]  is the orthogonalization matrix
                                   h = (h k l)

    3. Scattering vector in crystal frame
        (x y z) = [Q][B] h
Polar coordinates:
         PolarTheta = arctan(sqrt(x**2 + y**2)/z)
         PolarPhi   = arctan(y/x)
                             where [Q] is a permutation matrix to put
                                       h, k, or l along z (see POLE option)
                                   [B]  is the orthogonalization matrix
                                   h = (h k l)

   then
 Shl = 1  +  Sum[l=1,lmax] Sum[m=-l,+l] Clm  Ylm(PolarTheta,PolarPhi)
                             where Ylm is the spherical harmonic function for
                                       the direction given by the polar angles
                                   Clm are the coefficients determined by
                                       the program

   Notes:
     * The initial term "1" is essentially the l = 0 term, but with a
       fixed coefficient.
     * The number of terms = (lmax + 1)**2 - 1
     * Even terms (ie l even) are centrosymmetric, odd terms antisymmetric
     * Restraining all terms to zero (with the TIE SURFACE) reduces the
       anisotropic correction. This should always be done
