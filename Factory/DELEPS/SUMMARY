 *** Warning messages ***

 *** SERIOUS PROBLEMS ***
 ========================
 The following problems may have a significant effect on data quality
 Action should be taken to eliminate these warnings.

 ERROR IN DETECTOR GAIN
 ======================
 The ratio of the observed variation in background pixels to that
 expected statistically (the BGRATIO) lies outside the range 0.9 to 1.1.
 Actual values: minimum:  0.90  maximum:  0.90
 The most likely explanation is that the GAIN of the detector is incorrect.
 The current GAIN is 0.30 but the observed BGRATIO suggests it should be
 set to 0.24.
 NOTE however that diffuse scatter can lead to an increased value of BGRATIO
 even when the gain is correct.
 Since the gain for any detector should remain constant, it should be worked out
 for a crystal giving strong diffraction and "clean" spots (ie no disorder or
 diffuse scatter)and kept at this value.
 Processing data with an incorrect gain will result in a systematic 
 overestimate of very weak reflections and incorrect standard deviations.


 *** PROBLEMS WORTH CONSIDERING ***
 ==================================
 The following warnings suggest that the processing might be improved
 if appropriate action is taken.


 POOR PROFILES IN SOME AREAS
 ===========================
 For  9 profiles the correlation coefficient with the central profile is less than 0.5.
 Smallest correlation coefficient is -0.07
 Possible reasons are:
 1) Very weak diffraction (consider cutting back the resolution)
 2) Errors in cell parameters (check DELX, DELY for the standard profiles).
 3) Genuine variation due to high obliquity (for example).
 4) Presence of zingers or spots from an ice or salt crystal which are much
 stronger than the protein spots. Sometimes these can be rejected using
 the PROFILE CUTOFF keywords.

 A low correlation does NOT necessarily mean that the processing needs to be changed.

 The image number, profile box number and correlation coefficient for
 up to the first 6 occurences are:
   ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN     ID BOX CORRLN   
    1   1   0.38      1   3   0.05      1   6   0.39      1  15   0.24
    1  16   0.30      1  17  -0.07


 *** THE FOLLOWING ARE MAINLY FOR INFORMATION ***
 ================================================
 In some cases it may be possible to change the processing to eliminate
 some of these warnings.

 AVERAGING OF STANDARD PROFILES
 ==============================
 Profile averaging has been performed for some of the standard profiles.
 If possible this should be avoided, eg by accumulating the profiles
 over more images (BLOCK parameter on PROCESS keyword).
 Do not attempt to process spots that are not really there !
 If profiles are being averaged because the RMSBG is too high, but 
 this is because of diffuse scatter, it is best to increase the maximum 
 allowed RMSBG (default value 20.0): PROFILE RMSBG 25 (for example).

 TOO MANY BACKGROUND PIXELS OVERLAPPED BY NEIGHBOURING SPOTS
 ===========================================================
 For some of the standard profiles, more than half the background pixels are
 flagged as being overlapped by neighbouring spots (in the worst case,  63.3%
  are overlapped).
 You should use the SEPARATION CLOSE keywords, eg SEPARATION 1.0 1.0 CLOSE
